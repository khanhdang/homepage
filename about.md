**Hi, my name is Khanh!**<br><br>
_Present:_

I am a Ph.D. student at [Adaptive Systems Laboratory](http://adaptive.u-aizu.ac.jp) of the [University of Aizu](http://www.u-aizu.ac.jp/en/).  <br>
I research about fault-tolerance techniques and their analytical models for [3D Integrated Circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_integrated_circuit)/3D Network-on-Chips.



_Contact:_

You can find me [on Github](https://github.com/khanhdang), [on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dnk0904/), and [on my lab website](http://adaptive.u-aizu.ac.jp/?page_id=849). <br>
Want to talk? Feel free to [email](mailto:khanh.n.dang@ieee.org) me.

_Past:_

I was at [Smart Integrated Systems Laboratory](http://sis.uet.vnu.edu.vn/en) (2011-2014). I received a B.Sc. and a M.Sc. from [VNU University of Engineering and Technology](http://e.uet.vnu.edu.vn/) and [University of Paris Sud](http://www.u-psud.fr/en/index.html), respectively.

<p>I am a <strong>PhD student</strong> work on <a href="http://aslweb.u-aizu.ac.jp/wiki/index.php?Research">Reliable 
3D-NoC Processor for Real-time Image Processing</a> under the supervision of <a href="http://web-ext.u-aizu.ac.jp/~benab/">Prof. Abderazek Ben Abdallah</a> at 
<a href="http://aslweb.u-aizu.ac.jp/">ASL</a>, 
<a href="http://www.u-aizu.ac.jp/e-index.html">the University of Aizu</a>, Japan. My research involves 3D Integrated Circuit, Fault-Tolerant Techniques and Network-on-Chip.</p>

<p>Before enrolling the University of Aizu in 2014, 
I was at <a href="http://e.uet.vnu.edu.vn/">VNUH-UET</a> for several years, 
first as a <nobr>bachelor student</nobr>, 
then as a <nobr>master student</nobr> of Joint Master Program with 
<a href="http://www.u-psud.fr/en/index.html">University of Paris-Sud 11</a>, France. I also did theses under the supervision of <a href="http://www.uet.vnu.edu.vn/~tutx/">Prof. Xuan-Tu Tran</a>.</p>

<p>During my research time, I did spend huge amount of time on Network-on-Chip and video encoder design. 
One of our design, called as VENGME, won <a href="http://nhantaidatviet.vnpt.vn/ShowNews.aspx?lang=vn&cat=012013&nid=1271">second price</a> of "Nhân Tài Đất Việt" 2015.</p>

**Hi, This is Khanh!**<br>

I am a doctoral student at [Adaptive Systems Laboratory](http://adaptive.u-aizu.ac.jp), The [University of Aizu](http://www.u-aizu.ac.jp/en/). I have conducted researches on [3D Integrated Circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_integrated_circuit) designs, fault-tolerance techniques, and analytical models. The main theme of my dissertation is 3D Network-on-Chips.

You can find me [on Github](https://github.com/khanhdang), [on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dnk0904/), and [on my lab website](http://adaptive.u-aizu.ac.jp/?page_id=849).

I was at [Smart Integrated Systems Laboratory](http://sis.uet.vnu.edu.vn/en) from 2011 to 2014 as a reseacher. I helped build VENGME, an ASIC H.264 encoder which is fully implemented on hardware. The project won the second position prize of Nhan Tai Dat Viet 2015 - the biggest annual ICT competition in Vietnam. 

I grew up in a small village in Hanoi, Vietnam. I graduated from [VNU University of Engineering and Technology](http://e.uet.vnu.edu.vn/) (bachelor degree) and [University of Paris Sud](http://www.u-psud.fr/en/index.html) (master degree).

 こんにちわ！

I woke up late yesterday then checked my email. Surprisingly, I got an email about thank letter that sent to me via CSIP office. I joined a talk event at Kawahigashi Junior High School last month about my country and felt incrediblely about Japanese young students and teachers. They event give me a flower and small money as present (It is not voluteering, please do not confuse). Here is me while talking about World Heritages of Vietnam (which were recognized by UNESCO):


Lately, they sent me a thankful letter (I guess they have small vacation on New Year Holiday so it is a little bit late). They also give me a CD-R which include all photos of me.

Yeah, I have to say that it is so amazing about Japanese. They are so cute and thoughtful to me.

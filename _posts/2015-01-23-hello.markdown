Hello!

This is the first post on my own website. I just bought a domain yesterday then tried to figure out how to set up my website.
Firstly, I think I can setup with wordpress for fee but they required me to pay about 10$ per year for this service. So this is just too much because I already paid for my domain.

Formerly I maintained my personal website in github since last year. Therefore I think that I can use CNAME to point to this for free (it is amazing). I googled it and it is worked. 

Yesterday I put my old website which is actually a one-page html on my new domain but I think it's just "unprofessionally". Especially, I need to post some articles but using html and handle link is inconvenient. I tried to google again then find out that I can setup [jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) to generate my website base on Markdown. I have a lot chances to do with Markdown in the past so it is just easy for me and closes to HTML. After wasting a morning, I finally finished it.

Now I have new host for free with basical function (I think PHP doesn't work here!). Since I am not professional blogger so I satisfy with this. 

Thank you very much for reading this article and see you later.

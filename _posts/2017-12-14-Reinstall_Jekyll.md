Hey, this is Khanh :).

After using an HTML page for months, I have decided to switch back to a better interactive version. My zen time is over. After considering several static website generators, I have installed a Jekyll page again for my website (Ugh, that's boring). The CSS is also customized to fit my desires (short of).

I am still not sure whether I keep blogging here, but for the time being, I gonna keep it as it is. The demo pages of several projects have not been updated, so the 404 may appear sometimes.

This is the screen shot of my website so far.

In other news, I suppose to spend time on visualization. I have used [Processing](http://processing.org) for visualizing my last paper. It could be a nice chance to explore more things with this field.

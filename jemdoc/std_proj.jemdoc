= Student Projects

Followings are some notable student project I helped mentor. All the works were done by the students. I am just the guy who encourage them.

== Real-time Gaming System
- Designing a small game on Artix7 (AC701) with dual-core Microblazes (one controls HDMI, one mangages/renders the game). The game is programed based on FreeRTOS.

Our students attended the SEACAS 2019 Hackathon and won the 1st prize. 
The project is to develope a prototype of ``Magic Spoon'' which can compensate the vibration (shaking) 
of Parkinson patient's hand. Instead of using conventional PID, our students developed a single layer perceptron to control the servo motor. 
Database and Andriod app are also developed to provide the ability to diagnosis and proper treatment.

Our students will participate the IEEE CASS Student Design Competition which is organized as a part of ISCAS 2020 at Seville, Spain.

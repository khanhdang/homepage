== Javascript
So, I am kind of a big fan of visualization. In the last couple years, I have been wandering around the Internet to find some projects that I am interested in. Among them, [p5.js](https://p5js.org) is one of my favourties.
I did spend some time with it and so these are some projects:

. RacingJS: \[[./repos/RacingJS/RacingJS/index.html link]\].
. MicroMouse: \[[./repos/uMouse/index.html link]\].
. Routing Animation: \[[./repos/noc_ani/Javascript/demo.html link]\].
. Routing Prob.: \[[./repos/routing-prob/p5-routing.html link]\].
. O-An-Quan (testing) : \[[./repos/OAQ/p5js/index.html link]\].

Some of them are partly done (I guess I dont have enough free time tho). If you want to contribute them, feel free to fork and push some requests.

== HDL Visual

I make a tool to read HDL file then export illustration file (CSV, SVG and PDF).
The program is written in Python and open-source.

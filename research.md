## Current research topics

### 3D Silicon Brain Architecture  
We develop hardware for neuromorphic computing that mimics the behavior of biological brains. Here, the main target is to port the silicon brains into ASIC/FPGA and train them with bio-plausible learning approaches. <a role="button" href="./research_topics/neuromorphic" class="btn btn-success btn-sm">More details</a>

### Machine learning for Computer-Aided Design
We target to develop a machine learning framework for fault recovery in parallel and distributed systems.  A faulty computing element's task can be migrated to other nodes to allow fault-tolerance computing.  <a role="button" href="./research_topics/mlcad" class="btn btn-success btn-sm">More details</a>

### Thermal-aware 3D interconnect design
We target to develop algorithms and architectures to solve the on-line defect on 3D-interconnect with awareness of thermal impact.

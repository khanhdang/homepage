title: AI for Computer-Aided Design
---

We target to develop an AI framework for fault recovery in parallel and distributed systems.  A faulty computing element's task can be migrated to other nodes to allow fault-tolerance computing.

One of our research approach is to convert the constraints in the design phases (i.e., area, power, reliability, thermal) into a multiple-objective optimization.
Here we solve the problems using Genetic Algorithm (GA). GA can also be used in the run-time adaption.

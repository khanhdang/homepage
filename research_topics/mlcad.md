title: AI for Computer-Aided Design
---

In this project, we  develop an AI framework for designing and maintaince multi/many-core system.  One of our research approach is to convert the constraints in the design phases (i.e., area, power, reliability, thermal) into a multiple-objective optimization. Here, we solve the problems using Genetic Algorithm (GA).

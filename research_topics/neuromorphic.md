title:  3D Silicon Brain Architecture
---

We develop hardware for neuromorphic computing that mimics the behavior of biological brains. Here, the main target is to port the silicon brains into ASIC/FPGA and train them with bio-plausible learning approaches.

We have developed a LIF neuron model with STDP learning. Neurons are clustered and placed in a node of a 3D-NoC system that supports both unicast and multicast communications.

Furthermore, offline training has been investigating to deploy complex applications. We also plan to support the fault-tolerance feature for our 3D silicon brain.

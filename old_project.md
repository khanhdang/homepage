***VLSI Design of H.264 Inter-Prediction Encoder***


The main target of this project is to design a completed hardware architecture for processing the inter-prediction of H.264 encoder. The architecture is designed in a CMOS 180nm technology with the ability to perform  a real-time 720p encoding process.

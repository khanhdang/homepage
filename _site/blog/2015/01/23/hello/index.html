<p>Hello!</p>

<p>This is the first post on my own website. I just bought a domain yesterday then tried to figure out how to set up my website.
Firstly, I think I can setup with wordpress for fee but they required me to pay about 10$ per year for this service. So this is just too much because I already paid for my domain.
&lt;!--more--&gt;
Formerly I maintained my personal website in github since last year. Therefore I think that I can use CNAME to point to this for free (it is amazing). I googled it and it is worked. </p>

<p>Yesterday I put my old website which is actually a one-page html on my new domain but I think it&#39;s just &quot;unprofessionally&quot;. Especially, I need to post some articles but using html and handle link is inconvenient. I tried to google again then find out that I can setup <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll">jekyll</a> to generate my website base on Markdown. I have a lot chances to do with Markdown in the past so it is just easy for me and closes to HTML. After wasting a morning, I finally finished it.</p>

<p>Now I have new host for free with basical function (I think PHP doesn&#39;t work here!). Since I am not professional blogger so I satisfy with this. </p>

<p>Thank you very much for reading this article and see you later.</p>

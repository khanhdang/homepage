            <p>Hi!</p>

<p>There are a lot of methods for tracking and managing our schedule. They are called as todo notes. 
We have tone of apps on mobile like Any.Do, Wunderlist, so on. We can use Evernote, text file to do it.
Some people (like me) use email as todo note. Another calendar apps, ex: google calendar is just awesome 
to schedule.

Last year, I mostly used my email inbox and gcal to track my working progress as well as another events. To be honest,
this is the most effective system for me. Short, linking together, online, secure and so on. You can easily track on phone, 
laptop, desktop. </p>

<p>Somehow this year I really that I am becoming to hate my devices because it costs a lot of my time. Every time I pick up my phone, 
I will check my email, calendar, facebook, website and ton of things. Further more, I cannot track back what I done last month, week 
and evaluate it. So, I changed to analogy stuff. Sound strange for computer engineering student but yes.</p>

<p>Firstly, I use big notebook to do it. Write down everyday, month, year and so on. I feel so easy to to track my progress. I know how 
I work this week, what I have to enhance, what is the main problem. However, it is inconvenient if I bring my notebook to everywhere.
I really love it but I have to changed.</p>

<p>I bought a pocket calendar from school store and it works so well. It have monthly schedule, weekly schedule and daily. But (it always says but)
this pocket is to small to write. Sometime, I’ve done and scheduled ton of thing a day but will do nothing next day. And sometime I cannot understand what I wrote 
because it is to short to read. Damn it.</p>

<p>I tried looking for another method on the internet and got <a href="http://bulletjournal.com">bullet journal</a>. </p>

<p>I think this is just an awesome idea for noting. Everything is clear and easy to track. I will not be limited by line or something.
In another the word, this is just doing it in small notebook instead of big one. And the way to organize is just awesome.</p>

<p>P/S: about the pen and notebooks, Japanese product is just simply the best (as my experience). I don’t know the name of notebook 
but I usually use Pilot and Uni-ball pen. I found a magic pen by Pilot which write similarly as water pen but erasable like pencil. Of course 
I don’t know the brand, just Pilot.</p>

<p>Edit (2015-03-11): I am now using <a href="http://www.midori-japan.co.jp/tr/">Midori Traveller Notebook</a> and 
<a href="http://www.mpuni.co.jp/products/ballpoint_pens/gel/signo_cap/signo/um_151.html">Uni-ball Signo DX</a>. 
Midori notebook is easy to mix-up with a lot of additional parts and you can add more notebook, 
even put 3 or 4 or even more notebooks together. I also want to convert it into a wallet.
Erasable ballpoint pen from Pilot is still good for me but its colour is not bold enough in Midori’s paper.</p>

                        <p>I used to draw in MS Visio for 4-5 years. This tool is quite strong for drawing and it support to export
into vector format (EPS or PDF) that you can include inside Latex easily with better quality. Obviously, 
you can find out some tools that support drawing then export Latex file. However if you still have to work 
with MS Word, Visio is best choice.</p>

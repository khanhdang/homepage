## Xin chào!  Hi! こんにちは！

<img src="images/me_SISLAB.jpg" class="avatar" alt="Avatar">

Hi, my name is **Khanh N. Dang** (family name: Dang (Đặng, IPA: ɗa̰ʔŋ˨˩), first name: Khanh (Khánh, IPA: xajŋ˧˥), in Vietnamese: Đặng Nam Khánh, in カタカナ: カイン ナム コイン). 


I am an *Assistant Professor* of [VNU University of Engineering and Technology (VNU-UET)](https://e.uet.vnu.edu.vn/), [Vietnam National University, Hanoi (VNU)](https://vnu.edu.vn/eng/). I also a researcher at [VNU-key Laboratory for Smart Integrated Systems](http://sis.uet.vnu.edu.vn/en) - one of the seven key laboratories of Vietnam National University, Hanoi.


 My current research topics are [(1) neuromorphic computing](./research), [(2) 3D Integrated Circuits technology](./research), [(3) Machine Learning for CAD](./research), and [(4) fault-tolerant computing](./research).

Please feel free to look around!

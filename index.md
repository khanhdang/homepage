Hi, you are visiting my website and my name is **Khanh N. Dang**. I am an *Assistant Professor* of VNU University of Engineering and Technology, Vietnam
National University, Hanoi (VNU), Vietnam.
I also work as a *Researcher* at the [VNU-key Laboratory of Smart Integrated Systems](http://sis.uet.vnu.edu.vn/).

This website has been my home page for years. I used to use [gemdoc](https://jemdoc.jaboc.net/) in the past and have converted to [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) recently. The old website can be accessed [here](http://khanhdang.github.io/jemdoc-modern). If you are interested in, you can access the current website source code [here](https://github.com/khanhdang/khanhdang.github.io) and the old one [here](https://github.com/khanhdang/jemdoc-modern).

Hi, you are visiting my website and my name is **DANG Nam Khanh** (family name: Dang, first name: Khanh, in Vietnamese: Đặng Nam Khánh). I am an *Assistant Professor* of VNU University of Engineering and Technology, Vietnam
National University, Hanoi (VNU), Vietnam.
I also work as a *Researcher* at the [VNU-key Laboratory of Smart Integrated Systems](http://sis.uet.vnu.edu.vn/).

My current research topics now are neuromorphic computing, 3D Integrated Circuits, and fault-tolerant computing.

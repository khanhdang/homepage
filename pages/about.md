Hi. My name is Khanh N. Dang. I am currently working as a researcher at <a href="http://sis.uet.vnu.edu.vn" class="post-style" >SISLAB</a> of <a href="http://www.vnu.edu.vn" class="post-style" >Vietnam National University Hanoi</a>. I do research on dependable System-on-Chips in both theoritical and engneering aspects. You can see my [publication list](/pages/publication.html) and [research page](/pages/research.html) for more details.

Before that, I lived in Japan in some years and fortunately (or unfortunately) get a Ph.D. degree.

***Fault-tolerance for Network-on-Chip systems***


The main target of this project is to provide a highly reliable Network-on-Chip infrastructure.
The system should be able to deal with all kind of faults: hard, soft, and through-silicon-via.
Moreover, the full process of detection, diagnosis, and recovery is extremely important due to the risk
of faulty operation time.

***Reliability Assessment using Analytical methods***


Due to the fact that reliability assessment may demand full chip implementations for testing, analyzing the systems in the early design stages is extremely useful.
Designers can roughly estimate the reliability of the systems before implementation. Furthermore, to help designers select the best fault-tolerant techniques, a good and well-thought comparison is also needed.
